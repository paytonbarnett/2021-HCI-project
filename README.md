# 2021-HCI-project

I made this project for my Web Designs class, we were given the opportunity to create a website on anything we wanted and I chose the game Smile For Me. We were tasked with creating 2 different CSS files for the main page so the user could see alternate views. All images referenced in my code are uploaded here, and proper credit is given within the code and is visible when the website is opened.
